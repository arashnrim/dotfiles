# dotfiles

Welcome to the repository for my dotfiles! Dotfiles are configuration files for a wide variety of programs; they are usually created by the program and accessed later on to read configuration details stored previously. Under the hood, this repository uses [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm) — huge thank you to the creators and contributors who put effort and work into creating this!

This repository might hold many dotfiles, but a few that might be of interest is shown in the table below. Have a look for yourself, if you'd like!

| [.zshrc](https://github.com/arashnrim/dotfiles/blob/main/.zshrc%23%23default) | The configuration files for the `zsh` shell, my primary shell of choice. |

## Motivations

I wanted to have a dotfiles repository after coming across many others by many different developers out there. I was particularly fond about the concept of giving people a sneak peek of how one has set things up especially for themself. I was inspired to create one too after this!

Another reason is the fact that it enables me to easily synchronise my dotfiles between different computers or installations if I need to make a switch. With yadm supporting alternate files that work for different systems, I can configure different dotfiles and tweak them individually for each OS.
